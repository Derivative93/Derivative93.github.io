                    <p>
                        I am a dedicated law student with a keen interest in sport, technology and economics. I recently reached the quarterfinals of a national Commercial Awareness 
                        competition hosted by Aspiring Solicitors. Through this, I gained a broader understanding and knowledge of the business world and the companies that dominate our economy. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I am pursuing a career in commercial law. I am particularly interested in intellectual property, contract law and real estate. I keep myself informed of the latest
                        news and updates surrounding these fields.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        In order to maintain my ability to speak, write and understand both French and German, I often practice with foreign friends and read European news articles. I am learning Spanish
                        in my own time and intend to learn both Italian and Polish in the future.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I am a technophile and have built several computers. I follow the latest technology company offerings and I keep abreast of eSports developments. I can type at over 100 words
                        per minute and I am proficient in the use of basic and advanced software.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I regularly attend a pub quiz with friends in my spare time, and also enjoy playing football and tennis. Having completed my grade 7 exam some years ago, I continue to learn new
                        piano pieces to ensure that I retain the skill.

                    I assisted trainees in the commercial, corporate and real estate departments with several administrative tasks. I was given contracts to review, clerical documents to complete
                    and was introduced to the daily life of a commercial lawyer, both in a London and a regional office. I was also taught to navigate websites such as Practical Law, which has also been helpful in my studies.

                    At Browne Jacobson, I spent a few days with a variety of commerical departments, including the Banking Law team with whom I drafted a debenture. With the contracts law team, I helped to translate
                    contracts from German into English and was invited to and attended both internal and external seminars.

                    With Klinge Hess I had the opportunity to see how the German legal system functions. I accompanied my supervisor to advocacy trials which, although initially difficult to follow, were fascinating
                    in their difference to English law. I also completed some basic administrative tasks, such as filing legal documents and retrieving court-issued documents.

It is vital to work together in

			chat with the regular frequenters to keep them entertained and, on occasion, I would have to process complaints.
			When I wasn't working alone, each team member would work in tandem with one another so that we could serve customers
			at a quicker rate.

                	This was my first experience in the food industry. As a shop assistant, I helped customers choose which product

			flavours which could help determine their choice. As a waiter, I took orders and served food and drinks. It was imperative
			to work as a team to streamline the serving process and ensure a positive experience for the customer.

			I organised the venue, materials, props and managed invitations. The event was a success as I had tailored the time

			did not scan a document that was out of date as we would often have more than one patient record per patient.

                    	I organised activities, worked with children and acted as a role model. As I was working with fairly young children, creating games
			that were both fun and would help their tennis ability was a challenge in my job, but one that I enjoyed facing. Furthermore, 
			managing their sometimes hyper and immature behaviour would present a struggle, but I always found an appropriate solution
			which would necessarily be punitive. I also achieved my Level One tennis coaching award after completing a course to do so.

			An example of this is the general feeling amongst my classmates that when we have to solve tasks with multiple sections, the way
			that teachers split them up between tables often leads to a greater focus on one aspect of the issue and a much lesser focus
			on all of the others. I brought this concern to the LPC coordinator who said that it was an issue they were hearing from their
			institutions around the country and something they were looking to change.
