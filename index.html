                    I am a dedicated law student with a keen interest in sport, technology and economics. I recently reached the quarterfinals of a national Commercial Awareness 
                    competition hosted by Aspiring Solicitors. I am pursuing a career in commercial law. I am particularly interested in intellectual property, commercial dispute resolution and pensions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I have highly competent IT skills and have built several computers. I follow the latest technology company offerings and I keep abreast of eSports developments. I can type at over 120 words
                    per minute and I am proficient in the use of basic and advanced software including the Office Suite, LexisNexis and PLC.

                    <p>
                    In order to maintain my ability to speak, write and understand both French and German, I often practice with foreign friends and read European news articles. I am learning Spanish
                    in my own time and intend to learn both Italian and Polish in the future.

                    <p>
                    I regularly attend a pub quiz with friends and also enjoy playing football and tennis. Having completed my grade 7 exam some years ago, I continue to learn new
                    piano pieces to ensure that I retain the skill.

            <h3>Eversheds-Sutherland LLP, Birmingham</h3>
            <h4>Vacation Scheme</h4>
            <p>
                I spent two weeks with Eversheds-Sutherland, equally divided between the Commerical Dispute Resolution and Commercial Contracts teams. I was able to apply and consolidate my knowledge gained during my
                summer work experience with the firm. With the former department, I practiced drafting and assisted with client matters. With the latter, I prepared research notes and reviewed contracts. Concurrently, 
                I partook in assessed exercises which involved group discussion and social activities. Additionally, the Eversheds-Sutherland team expressed the importance of working with the local 
                community and gave us money to create relief packages for the homeless.

            <h3>Eversheds-Sutherland LLP, Birmingham and London</h3>
            <h4>Work Placement</h4>
            <p>
                I assisted trainees in the commercial, corporate and real estate departments with several administrative tasks. I was given contracts to review, clerical documents to complete
                and was introduced to the daily life of a commercial lawyer, both in a London and a regional office. I was also taught to navigate websites such as Practical Law, which has also been helpful in my studies.

        <div data-date="August 2011">
            <h3>Browne Jacobson LLP, Birmingham</h3>
            <h4>Work Placement</h4>
            <p>
                At Browne Jacobson, I spent a few days with a variety of commerical departments, including the Banking Law team with whom I drafted a debenture. With the contracts law team, I helped to translate
                contracts from German into English and was invited to and attended both internal and external seminars.
            </p>

        <div data-date="April 2011">
            <h3>Klinge Hess Law Firm, Koblenz</h3>
            <h4>Work Placement</h4>
            <p>
                With Klinge Hess I had the opportunity to see how the German legal system functions. I accompanied my supervisor to advocacy trials which, although initially difficult to follow, were fascinating
                in their difference to English law. I also completed some basic administrative tasks, such as filing legal documents and retrieving court-issued documents.

            <h3>Tesco, Knowle</h3>
            <h4>Customer Service Assistant</h4>
            <p>
                The prime focus of my job is to ensure that the customer leaves happy and that the store is kept neat. My team and I work to improve the physical appearance of the shop by continually stocking and replenishing the shelves and by appropriately rotating stock to minimise food waste. It is vital to work together in 
                this environment in order to expedite the process, thereby making sure that the customer is able to find and purchase the goods they want. I also work on the checkouts, providing a friendly
                point of contact for the customers. Furthermore, I have provided checkouts training for incoming staff.

            <h3>The Railway Inn, Dorridge</h3>
            <h4>Barman</h4>
            <p>
                As a barman in a pub, I had to process food and drink orders. Often I would be working alone behind the bar and would therefore
                have a large amount of responsibility in furthering the good reputation of the establishment. I would 
                chat with the regular frequenters to keep them entertained and, on occasion, I would have to process complaints.
                When I wasn't working alone, each team member would work in tandem with one another so that we could serve customers
                at a quicker rate.

            <h3>The Bread Collection, Knowle</h3>
            <h4>Shop assistant and Waiter</h4>
            <p>
                This was my first experience in the food industry. As a shop assistant, I helped customers choose which product
                they wished to purchase. In order to do so, I had to learn what each type of bread and pastry was called and the accompanying
                flavours which could help determine their choice. As a waiter, I took orders and served food and drinks. It was imperative
                to work as a team to streamline the serving process and ensure a positive experience for the customer.

                My role was general assistance with procurement including inputting orders, excel spreadsheet work and communicating with 
                other departments. I arranged a "Listening Into Action" Event which was attended by approximately 80 people and 
                I organised the venue, materials, props and managed invitations. The event was a success as I had tailored the time
                and date of the event to coincide with the availability of those we required to attend.

            <p>
                My role in the Medico-Legal department was wholly administrative. I handled and scanned sensitive patient documents,
                filed patient records and used the computer systems to record those that had been filed. I had to be alert so that I
                did not scan a document that was out of date as we would often have more than one patient record per patient.

            <h4>Assistant Tennis Coach</h4>
            <p>
                I organised activities, worked with children and acted as a role model. As I was working with fairly young children, creating games
                that were both fun and would help their tennis ability was a challenge in my job, but one that I enjoyed facing. Furthermore, 
                managing their sometimes hyper and immature behaviour would present a struggle, but I always found an appropriate solution
                which would necessarily be punitive. I also achieved my Level One tennis coaching award after completing a course to do so.

            <h4>Class Representative</h4>
            <p>
                I act as the bridge between the students in my class and the staff hierarchy, bringing suggestions from my classmates to those that can enact them.
                An example of this is the general feeling amongst my classmates that when we have to solve tasks with multiple sections, the way
                that teachers split them up between tables often leads to a greater focus on one aspect of the issue and a much lesser focus
                on all of the others. I brought this concern to the LPC coordinator who said that it was an issue they were hearing from their
                institutions around the country and something they were looking to change.

            <p>
                I mentored and regularly met with two students, one from Germany and one from England, in order to allow for their smooth transition to life at the university.
                My ability to speak German certainly helped with this, and often it would be as simple as meeting up with the students for a drink
                and having a discussion about how they're finding the change. The students became my friends, which created a bond of trust between us
                and significantly helped them to settle in.

            <p>
                I assisted at a local Beaver Scouts group once a week, organising activities for and looking after the children. As with the tennis coaching,
                young children can often present behavioural problems, but being able to manage it in a way that lets the child know that they have
                acted inappropriately whilst also not causing them to be too upset is vital.
